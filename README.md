Hello, here is my final submission for the "Labs + Mini-Project track".

## Project
I have chosen to try and imporve "Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews".
* My goal was to show that the vanilla algorithm face issues while encountering review with mixed feelings.

My idea was for my algorithm to learn to discriminate reviews with mixed feelings and remove them from the accuracy computation. The discriminative power of my algorithm is captured by a parameter going with range in [0, 1]. <br>

In this paper, I have shown the evolution of the Sentiment Analysis classification performance according to the discrimination power on mixed feelings review.
